Abstract of Project:
Considering the successful results of deep neural networks in this field, the aim is to develop a deep learning algorithm that can classify 10 different music genres. We make the classification using the GTZAN dataset, which was previously used in many studies and retains its validity. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify music genres, considering the previous successful results. We represent music segments in the dataset by Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) instead of using visual features or representations. We obtain MFCCs by preprocessing the music pieces in the dataset, then train a CNN model with the acquired MFCCs and determine the success of the model with the testing data. As a result of this, we developed a model that is successful in classifying music genres by using smaller data.
